        Please define the acceptance criteria for the feature using the following BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) format:
        - **Given** [initial context or state],
        - **When** [action/event to trigger the behavior],
        - **Then** [expected outcome or result].

        **Examples:**
        - Given the user is on the login page, When the user clicks on the "Forgot Password?" link, Then the user should be redirected to the password recovery page.
        - Given the user is on the password recovery page, When the user enters a valid email address and clicks "Submit", Then a password reset link should be sent to the user's email address.

        Make sure to cover edge cases and all scenarios that need validation.
